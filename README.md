# Realtime System Monitoring.

> IF4025 - Pervasive Computing Course at Institut Teknologi Sumatera (ITERA).

**Simple real-time system monitoring** is an application that focuses on sending **CPU Usage**, **CPU Frequency**, **Virtual Memory Usage**, and **Network (*bytes_sent* and *bytes_received*)** data from a computer to **Firebase**, then displaying the data in real-time on a website using **Flask** deployed to **Vercel**. You can modify it to send and display other data in real-time.

## IF4025 - Pervasive Computing

This course covers the principles and practices of pervasive computing (ubiquitous computing), also known as the Internet of Things (IoT). The course provides an in-depth, hands-on experience: students will work in small teams to design an IoT project. In addition, students will present an overview and summary of the commercial landscape of one of the topics covered in class, also in small teams. There will be a short quiz at the beginning of each class based on the readings for the class.
